Hi Saahil, I like the start of your code where you declare your name and information. There are some minor spelling mistakes that doesn't affect the code but it does affect the reading aspect of it. You can try to include the constant in the your main story and also try the different console log with the ${} as it would change and improve your coding. other than that, everything else seems good, keep up the good work

Hi Saahil, I like hte formationg of the console logs, but i have few suggestions. When declaring variables try and be mindful of how they are working, or if they were already declared. there are a couple erroes that could show up from them. Other then that organising the code might help a bit, week it up.
